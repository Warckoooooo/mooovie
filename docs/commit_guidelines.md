# Commit Message Conventions

For **Mooovie**, I want to follow the conventionalcommits.org
guidelines [cheat sheet here](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Conventional_Commits.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index)

- **build**: Changes related to the build system, build scripts, or build dependencies.

- **chore**: General maintenance tasks, changes to the development process, or changes that are neither features nor
  bug fixes.

- **ci**: Changes to configuration files or scripts related to continuous integration and continuous deployment.

- **docs**: Documentation-related changes, such as adding or updating comments in source code or user documentation.

- **feat**: Addition of a new feature or capability to the project.

- **fix**: Correction of an existing bug or issue in the code.

- **perf**: Changes aimed at improving the performance of the application, such as optimizing algorithms or reducing
  loading times.

- **refactor**: Restructuring of existing code without adding or removing features, often to improve code
  readability or maintainability.

- **revert**: Complete or partial reversal of a previous commit.

- **style**: Style-related changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, such as formatting, punctuation, or
  removal of unnecessary whitespace.

- **test**: Addition or modification of unit tests, integration tests, or functional tests.

- **!**: For major changes

Using these prefixes consistently can help classify commits and clarify their purpose when reviewing the version history
of a project.
